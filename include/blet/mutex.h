     * threads.
     *
     * mutex offers exclusive, non-recursive ownership semantics:
     *
     * A calling thread owns a mutex from the time that it successfully calls
     * either lock or try_lock until it calls unlock. When a thread owns a
     * mutex, all other threads will block (for calls to lock) or receive a
     * false return value (for try_lock) if they attempt to claim ownership of
     * the mutex. A calling thread must not own the mutex prior to calling lock
     * or try_lock. The behavior of a program is undefined if a mutex is
     * destroyed while still owned by any threads, or a thread terminates while
     * owning a mutex.
